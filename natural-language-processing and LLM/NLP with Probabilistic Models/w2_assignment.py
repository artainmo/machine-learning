#Tagging is difficult because some words can represent more than one part of speech at different times. They are Ambiguous. 
#Let's look at the following example for the word 'well':
# * The whole team played well. [adverb]
# * You are doing well for yourself. [adjective]
# * Well, this assignment took me forever to complete. [interjection]
# * The well is dry. [noun]
# * Tears were beginning to well in her eyes. [verb]
#Distinguishing the parts-of-speech of a word in a sentence help better understand the meaning of a sentence.

# * emission_counts: maps (tag, word) to the number of times it happened.
# * transition_counts: maps (prev_tag, tag) to the number of times it has appeared.
# * tag_counts: maps (tag) to the number of times it has occured.

#In this assignment, you predicted POS tags by walking forward through a corpus and knowing the previous word.
#There are other implementations that use bidirectional POS tagging.
#Bidirectional POS tagging requires knowing the previous word and the next word in the corpus when predicting the current word's POS tag.
#Since you have learned to implement the unidirectional approach, you have the foundation to implement other POS taggers used in industry.
